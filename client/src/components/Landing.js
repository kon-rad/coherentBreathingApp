      <h1>What is Coherent Breathing?</h1>

      <p>If you have the time to learn only one technique, this is the one to try. In coherent breathing, the goal
        is to breathe at a rate of five breaths per minute, which generally translates into inhaling and exhaling to
        the count of six. If you have never practiced breathing exercises before, you may have to work up to this
        practice slowly, starting with inhaling and exhaling to the count of three and working your way up to six.
